# Flappy-Box
Flappy Box will be something similar to the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. The game will be a side-scroller where the player controls a box, attempting to jump between rows of pipes without coming into contact with them. If the player touches the pipes, it ends the game. It will be done in WebGL.
